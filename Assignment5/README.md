# StockProfit Contract

The StockProfit contract is a Solidity-based smart contract designed for the Ethereum blockchain. Its primary function is to calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained from a list of stock prices given an array where each element represents the stock price for a given day. This contract could be a foundational element for financial analysis tools or decentralized applications (dApps) focused on investment strategies.

## Features

- Maximum Profit Calculation: Calculates the maximum profit from buying and selling at optimal days.
- Efficiency: Optimized for minimal gas consumption with pure function modifiers.
- Flexibility: Can handle an arbitrary list of daily prices passed as an input.

Before you deploy or interact with the StockProfit contract, ensure you have the following:

Node.js installed (version 12.x or higher recommended).
Remix Ide for compiling and deploying the contract.
MetaMask or any Ethereum wallet configured for the network you intend to deploy on.
